# Important Terms

If you don't come from a background in 3D art or game development
this page will help you learn some of the basics of 3D models and
rendering.

## What is a mesh?

A <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">mesh</span> when talking about 3D models is simply the model itself.
It's a series of <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">vertices</span> (points in 3D space) that are connected by 
<span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">edges</span> to form <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">faces</span>.

<span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">Faces</span> are what we see when the scene is rendered.

Models can be made up of 1 or more objects which themselves can be
made up of 1 or more mesh.

You may hear the term <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">emissive mesh</span> in the GTA/FiveM community. This
simply refers to a mesh with an emissive material on it. Commonly
used as police lights.

## What is a material/shader?

<span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">Shaders</span> or <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">materials</span> (depending on the context) are what give us control
over how the mesh will look when rendered. We can change the color of
shaders and many other factors including emissive strength and specular
values to simulate different materials.

In GTA/FiveM shaders use the <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">specular workflow</span> which includes a few
channels including Diffuse (color) and Specular (glossiness).

By default shaders will affect every pixel on the mesh the same way.
We can use <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">textures</span> to address different parts of the mesh with different
values in each channel.

## What is a texture?

A <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">texture</span> is simply an image file.
With a fancy name in the context of 3D.

We plug these images into a shader to make it output different values at different spots 
on the mesh. Without textures shaders will apply the same value to the whole mesh.


## TLDR

The <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">mesh</span> forms the shape of the 
3D object, the <span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">shader</span> makes the 
mesh look different based on inputted values,
<span className="nx-font-bold nx-text-blue-400">textures</span> add detail to shaders
by inputting different values at different spots on the mesh.
