## Suggest a change
 
 This method is the easiest and requires no coding knowledge or experience! Simply create
 a Github issue with your suggestion. Others will be able to view and discuss your suggestion
 within the issue, then if your suggestion is good, someone will add it to the docs!

<Steps>
### Create a new issue with your suggestion

<div className="nx-mt-8">
 <Button label="Create issue" href="https://github.com/dwnstr/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=suggestion&projects=&template=suggest-a-change.md&title=%5BSuggestion%5D+Your+title+here"/>
</div>

### Type your suggestion and create the issue!

That's it!
</Steps>

## Edit on web

If you have some experience with coding and markdown and you want to make your changes 
directly, the first option is by editing the files on Github's web editor!

<Steps>
### Find the page you want to edit

Most pages have a ``.mdx`` or ``.md`` file that directly matches it's title. For example,
this page would be found as ``how-to-contribute.mdx``.

Other files, however, don't match perfectly.

Pages are grouped the same way they are in the left sidebar!

<div className="nx-mt-8">
 <Button label="View files" href="https://github.com/dwnstr/docs/tree/main/pages"/>
</div>

### Click the pencil icon to edit

### Create a pull request

When prompted, fork the repository and then create your pull request to suggest
your edits! A maintainer will review your changes and either merge them with the
live site, or let you know what needs to be adjusted.

</Steps>

## Edit Locally

If you're experienced with programming and markdown, you can clone the repository and
make your changes locally.

<Steps>
### Clone the repo

### Initialize the project
```pnpm i```

```pnpm dev```

### Make your changes and submit a pull request!
