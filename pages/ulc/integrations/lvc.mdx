## LVC Integration is coming soon!

In the meantime [learn more about Luxart Vehicle Control](https://github.com/TrevorBarns/luxart-vehicle-control)

## Planned Features

In the future ULC will be able to set stages in accordance with siren changes in LVC.
For example, when switching to a wail siren, you could activate stage 1 lighting.
When switching to a yelp siren, you could activate stage 2 lighting. This will be
configurable in the `ulc.lua` configuration.
