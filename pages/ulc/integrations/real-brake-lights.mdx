## Overview

[Real Brake Lights](https://github.com/Flohhhhh/real-brake-lights) is a simple script that enables brake
lights while stopped on player vehicles. (By default in GTA V, brake lights only turn on while braking,
not once the vehicle has come to a complete stop.)

Real brake lights also features some smart logic to make the effect more realistic including
a timer to turn off the brake lights after being stopped for some time to simulate the driver
shifting the vehicle into park.

## ULC Integration

ULC is able to hook into Real Brake Lights, and uses it's brake logic to determine when to activate
the [brake extras](/ulc/configuration/brake-extras) feature. This means that all of the benefits of Real Brake Lights are available
to ULC users.

Real Brake Lights also listens for ULC [/blackout command](/ulc/in-game-usage#commands) events and will keep the brakelights disabled while
blackout is active.

## How to setup

All you need to do is have both resources running on your server. ULC will automatically detect
Real Brake Lights and listen for the brake light state changes.
