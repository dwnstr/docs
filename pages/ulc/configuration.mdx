# Configuration
An overview of ULC features and configuration options.

<Video url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIF3qqRY0Ts"/>

ULC was designed to be as user-friendly and flexible as possible.

It loads vehicle configurations from a file called `ulc.lua` that is located
within the vehicle resources themselves. This allows for easy setup,
and easy sharing of vehicle configurations. Vehicle developers can ship their
vehicles with a pre-configured `ulc.lua` file to make them ULC ready
out-of-the-box!

## Review the global settings

  The top section of the ``config.lua`` file in the root of the resource contains
  a series of global settings. These settings determine the behavior of some
  features.

  **Most of these settings can be left at their default values.**

  <Callout type="info">
    If you're using Luxart Vehicle Controls
    or a similar resource that plays a tone when lights are turned on
    you should set `muteBeepForLights` to `true`
  </Callout>

  ```lua
    -- whether to mute the tone that plays when lights are turned on 
    -- use if you have another resources that already plays a tone.
    muteBeepForLights = true,
    -- global toggle for UI (affects all clients)
    hideHud = false,
    -- whether to use KPH instead of MPH
    useKPH = false,
    -- health threshold for effect (probably don't touch this)
    healthThreshold = 990,

    ParkSettings = {
        -- Vehicle will be considered "parked" below this speed
        speedThreshold = 1,
        -- whether to disable the effect when a door is open (highly recommended)
        checkDoors = true,
        -- delay between checks, should not be lower than 0.5
        delay = 0.5,
        -- distance to sync park pattern (32 is roughly the Yellow Jack parking lot)
        syncDistance = 32,
        -- cooldown between sync attempts
        syncCooldown = 10,
    },
        
    SteadyBurnSettings = {
        nightStartHour = 18,
        -- should always be a lower number than start hour
        nightEndHour = 6,
        -- delay between checks, this can be very long, it will only make it more realistic
        delay = 10,
    },
    ...
  ```

## Configure your first vehicle

By default, no vehicles are affected by ULC. In order for a vehicle to 
be affected by ULC there must be a configuration for it. Let's start by setting up your first vehicle.

To do this, we will create a `ulc.lua` configuration file in your vehicle
resource folder, and then point ULC to that file so it can load it.

Follow the steps below!
<Steps>
  <Callout type="info">
    If your vehicle came with a `ulc.lua` file, skip to step 7.
  </Callout>

  ### Create `ulc.lua` file
  Create a file at the root of your vehicle resource and name it `ulc.lua`

  ### Open the [ULC Generator](http://ulc.dwnstr.com)
  {/* link card */}

  ### Define the model name
  Add the name of your vehicle to the `names={}` table.

  ### Configure vehicle settings

  ### Configure buttons

  ### Populate the `ulc.lua` file
  Copy the contents of the generator and paste them into your `ulc.lua` file.

  ### Add config to ULC
  Open your ULC `config.lua` file and find the `ExternalVehResources` table.
  Here you can add the resource name of the vehicle you just configured.

  This will tell ULC about the vehicle, and make it load the configuration
  from the `ulc.lua` file.

  ```lua
    ExternalVehResources = {
        "pd4",
    },
  ```

  ### Done!
  Your vehicle is now configured and ready to go!
  
  Restart ULC and test it out and then repeat for your other vehicles!

</Steps>

## Configuring a vehicle pack

If you have a resource with multiple vehicles in it that all use the same
ULC configuration, you can use a single `ulc.lua` file for all of them.

Simply include all of the model names in the `names` field of the `ulc.lua` file.

```lua
  names = {"pd4","pd5", "pd6"},
```

If there are vehicles in the resource that use a different configuration
you can create an additional configuration object within the same 
`ulc.lua` file.

## Creating Non-ELS Vehicles for ULC

Vehicle developers who are creating vehicles compatible with ULC can provide a local configuration file within their vehicle resources for use by users.

By providing a configuration file your vehicle will be pre-configured for all users who use it. Users will be able to simply plug-and-play your vehicle with ULC functionality.

Follow steps 1-5 above to learn how to create a ulc.lua file.

### Extras with Sirens

The concept of nesting Sirens into an Extra is critical to proper usage of ULC. Most of the features of ULC require sirens to be contained within extras.

All you have to do to set this up is parent your Sirens to an Extra once they are compounded. Your extra can have any other parts also attached. I.E you 
could have a divider to block the emissives behind the emissives you want to show, such as in the case of a traffic advisor.

<Callout>
  ULC works best when extras don't have collisions. If you have a collision on your extra, ULC will not be able to turn it on or off consistently.
