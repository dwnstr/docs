# Stages

## What are "Stages"?

Stages in ULC are simply a way to change the behavior of buttons to make them behave as a user would expect
cyclical/sequential stages (where the next stage includes the last one) to work. This allows stages to properly "build" on each other.
The only difference between a button defined as a stage and a standard button is that a stage will maintain awareness of other stages
and adjust it's on-off state accordingly.

Consider the example below:

```lua
buttons = {
  {label = "Stage 1", key = 1, color = "green", extra = 1, linkedExtras = {}, offExtras = {2,3}},
  {label = "Stage 2", key = 2, color = "green", extra = 2, linkedExtras = {1}, offExtras = {3}},
  {label = "Stage 3", key = 3, color = "green", extra = 3, linkedExtras = {1,2}, offExtras = {}}
},
```

With this setup, the linked and off extras are almost enough to make a proper stage system. Pressing the stage 3 button would enable both 1 and 2, however, if you were to
press 3 then press 2 to downgrade to stage 2, it would actually turn off all three stages since
stage 2 was already enabled.

The default behavior of buttons is to disable if it's already enabled. If a button is defined as a stage it will instead check the current stage
and if it's a different stage the button will instead remain active and the extras would be set accordingly. Only if the stage is the same as the
current stage will all of the stages be disabled.

  Defining only one button as a stage will have no effect!

## How to use Stages

Stages are defined in the "stages" section of the `ulc.lua` configuration file. Simply add any buttons you want to behave as stages to the `stageKeys` table by their key.

```lua
stages = {
  useStages = true,
  stagesKeys = {1, 2, 3}
}
```

  Make sure youre putting the button's KEY here and not the EXTRA!

For example, if your have a button like the one below the value you should place in `stageKeys` is 4 (not the extra number which is 12).

`{ label = "Stage 1", key = 4, extra = 12 ... }`
