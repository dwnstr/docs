# Reverse Extras

Reverse extras will turn on while vehicle is in reverse.

The intended use for this is adding reverse lights to the lightbar.

## How to Create Reverse Extras

To create reverse extras, simply create new emissive meshes to use, and parent them to an extra. Then add that extra to the reverse extras in the \`\`ulc.lua\`\`.\

If you want the reverse lights to have environment lighting, you should could make them a siren.

## Example ulc.lua

```lua
reverseConfig = {
    useReverse = true,
    reverseExtras = {12},
    disableExtras = {11}
},
```

## Reverse Timer

To achieve a more realistic result, the reverse feature has a built in timer that will disable the reverse extras after the vehicle
has not moved for a certain amount of time. This is to simulate the driver shifting out of reverse.

This timer has a randomness factor so it will turn off between 3 and 8 seconds after the vehicle stops moving.

This effect can be disabled to keep the reverse extras on until the player drives forward again by setting `useRandomExpiration` to false in the `config.lua`.
You can also adjust the minimum and maximum time by changing the `minExpiration` and `maxExpiration` values in the `config.lua`.

```lua
ReverseSettings = {
    useRandomExpiration = true,
    -- minumum time in seconds extras will stay on after vehicle stops moving
    minExpiration = 3,
    -- maximum time in seconds extras will stay on after vehicle stops moving
    maxExpiration = 8
},
```
