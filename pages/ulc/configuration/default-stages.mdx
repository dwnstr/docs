# Default Stages

## Overview

Default stages allows you to specify [buttons](buttons.mdx) or [stages](stages.mdx) that will either be enabled or disabled when the lighting is activated on the vehicle.

## Example Usage

### Example 1

You want to have the vehicle always be in Stage 1 of 3 when the lights are activated. You would create a button called "Stage 1".

```lua
{
  label = "Stage 1",
  key = 1,
  extra = 1,
  linkedExtras = {2, 3},
  oppositeExtras = {},
  offExtras = {}
}
```

add it as a stage in the `stages` section of `ulc.lua`,

```lua
stages = {
  useStages = true,
  stagesKeys = {1, 2, 3}
}
```

and then add the key to `enableKeys` in the `defaultStages` section.

```lua
defaultStages = {
  useDefaults = true,
  enableKeys = {1},
  disableKeys = {}
}
```

Now, whenever the lights are activated, the vehicle will always be in Stage 1.

### Example 2

Say I have a button to activate front lighting on my vehicle:

```lua
{
  label = "FRONT",
  key = 1,
  extra = 2,
  linkedExtras = {4},
  oppositeExtras = {},
  offExtras = {}
}
```

I want my front lighting to always be enabled when the lights are activated. I will add this stage to the default stages by adding the key, 1, to `enableKeys`:

```lua
defaultStages = {
  useDefaults = true,
  enableKeys = {1},
  disableKeys = {}
}
```

Now it will be as if the player pressed `NUM1` to activate the stage every time the lights turn on resulting in the stage always being active when lights are first activated.

## Conflicts

Keys are processed in the order they are listed in `enableKeys` and `disableKeys`. If 2 buttons are specified in `defaultStages` that reference the same extra as `linkedExtras`, `oppositeExtras`, or `offExtras`, the later key will override the earlier ones.
If more than one stage is specified in `defaultStages`, the last key pressed will determine the stage the vehicle is in when lights are activated.

Following the above example, if we had our "FRONT" lighting stage which references Extra 4 as a linkedExtra as well as another stage called "TA" which references Extra 4 as an offExtra, we will run into a conflict.

```lua
{
  label = "FRONT",
  key = 1,
  extra = 2,
  linkedExtras = {4},
  oppositeExtras = {},
  offExtras = {}
},
{
  label = "TA",
  key = 2,
  extra = 3,
  linkedExtras = {},
  oppositeExtras = {},
  offExtras = {4}
}
```

Later keys trigger after earlier ones, so if we listed "FRONT" as a defaultStage and then "TA", the result would be that extra 4 is off.

```lua
defaultStages = {
  useDefaults = true,
  enableKeys = {1, 2},
  disableKeys = {}
}
```

If we swap the order, the result would be that extra 4 is on.

```lua
defaultStages = {
  useDefaults = true,
  enableKeys = {2, 1},
  disableKeys = {}
}
```

Keep this in mind when using Default Stages!
