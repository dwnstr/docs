# Configuration
An overview of ULC features and configuration options.

<Video url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIF3qqRY0Ts"/>

ULC was designed to be as user-friendly and flexible as possible.

It loads vehicle configurations from a file called `ulc.lua` that is located
within the vehicle resources themselves. This allows for easy setup,
and easy sharing of vehicle configurations. Vehicle developers can ship their
vehicles with a pre-configured `ulc.lua` file to make them ULC ready
out-of-the-box!

## Review the global settings

  The top section of the ``config.lua`` file in the root of the resource contains
  a series of global settings. These settings determine the behavior of some
  features.

  **Most of these settings can be left at their default values.**

  <Callout type="info">
    If you're using Luxart Vehicle Controls
    or a similar resource that plays a tone when lights are turned on
    you should set `muteBeepForLights` to `true`
  </Callout>

  ```lua
    -- whether to mute the tone that plays when lights are turned on 
    -- use if you have another resources that already plays a tone.
    muteBeepForLights = true,
    -- global toggle for UI (affects all clients)
    hideHud = false,
    -- whether to use KPH instead of MPH
    useKPH = false,
    -- health threshold for effect (probably don't touch this)
    healthThreshold = 990,

    ParkSettings = {
        -- Vehicle will be considered "parked" below this speed
        speedThreshold = 1,
        -- whether to disable the effect when a door is open (highly recommended)
        checkDoors = true,
        -- delay between checks, should not be lower than 0.5
        delay = 0.5,
        -- distance to sync park pattern (32 is roughly the Yellow Jack parking lot)
        syncDistance = 32,
        -- cooldown between sync attempts
        syncCooldown = 10,
    },
        
    SteadyBurnSettings = {
        nightStartHour = 18,
        -- should always be a lower number than start hour
        nightEndHour = 6,
        -- delay between checks, this can be very long, it will only make it more realistic
        delay = 10,
    },
    ...
  ```

## Configure your first vehicle

By default, no vehicles are affected by ULC. In order for a vehicle to 
be affected by ULC there must be a configuration for it. Let's start by setting up your first vehicle.

To do this, we will create a `ulc.lua` configuration file in your vehicle
resource folder, and then point ULC to that file so it can load it.

Follow the steps below!
<Steps>

    If your vehicle came with a `ulc.lua` file, skip to step 7.
  </Callout>

  ### Create `ulc.lua` file
  Create a file at the root of your vehicle resource and name it `ulc.lua`

  ### Open the [ULC Generator](http://ulc.dwnstr.com)
  {/* link card */}

  ### Define the model name
  Add the name of your vehicle to the `names={}` table.

  ### Configure vehicle settings

  ### Configure buttons

  ### Populate the `ulc.lua` file
  Copy the contents of the generator and paste them into your `ulc.lua` file.

  ### Add config to ULC
  Open your ULC `config.lua` file and find the `ExternalVehResources` table.
  Here you can add the resource name of the vehicle you just configured.

  This will tell ULC about the vehicle, and make it load the configuration
  from the `ulc.lua` file.

  ```lua
    ExternalVehResources = {
        "pd4",
    },
  ```

  ### Done!
  Your vehicle is now configured and ready to go!
  
  Restart ULC and test it out and then repeat for your other vehicles!
