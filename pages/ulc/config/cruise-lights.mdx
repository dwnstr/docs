# Cruise Lights

The smart cruise lights feature allows you to use ULC to specify extras that will be force enabled either:
- Always
- Based on time of day

Cruise lights are designed to increase visibility while not responding to scenes. There are some special use cases for cruise lights as well.
For example, the Connecticut state police does not have liveries on their vehicles. Instead, they use cruise lights to identify the vehicles as police vehicles.

## How to Create Cruise Lights

To create cruise lights simply create an extra that is just emissive mesh. Make sure the emissives are dimmed down instead of full brightness!

Cruise lights don't have to be sirens. They can just be plain emissive meshes that aren't scaled down.
However, if you want environment lighting, or you want the steady burns to only show when the emergency lights are activated, then you should make these a siren.

## Global Settings
These settings are found in the ``config.lua`` file and affect the whole server.
### ``nightStartHour``
This value specifies the hour of the day when the cruise lights will activate.
```lua
nightStartHour = 18,
```
### ``nightEndHour``
This value specifies the hour of the day when the cruise lights will deactivate.
```lua  
nightEndHour = 6,
```
### ``delay``
This value specifies the delay between checks for the cruise lights.
```lua
delay = 10,
```

## Per-Vehicle Settings
These settings are found in ``ulc.lua`` and only effect the specified vehicle(s).

### ``forceOn``
This value specifies whether the cruise lights should be forced on.
If set to true, this will override the ``useTime`` setting and cruise lights
will be enabled at all times.
```lua
forceOn = false,
```
### ``useTime``
This value specifies whether the cruise lights should be enabled based on the time of day.
If set to true, cruise lights will be force enabled at night only.
```lua
useTime = true,
```
### ``disableWithLights``
This value specifies whether the cruise lights should be disabled when the main lights are activated.
```lua
disableWithLights = false,
```
### ``sbExtras``
This value specifies which extras should be force enabled as cruise lights.
```lua
sbExtras = {1, 2}
```
