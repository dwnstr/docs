  ### Extract
    
    - Extract ULC and place it in your resources folder.
    - The resource works best if you don't rename it from ``ulc``.
  ### Add to ``server.cfg``
    Add ``ensure ulc`` to your ``server.cfg`` file.

  ### Configure
  #### Quick Start
  If you're a server owner and you already have ULC compatible vehicles, all you have to do 
  to is let ULC know about the vehicles!

  Go to your ``config.lua`` file and add the vehicle resource names to the ``ExternalVehResources`` table.
  ```lua {2, 3, 4} filename="config.lua"
  ExternalVehResources = {
    "your-vehicle-resource-name",
    "another-vehicle",
    "vehiclepack",
  },
  ```
  <Callout>
    Make sure you add the **resource name** of the vehicle/pack, not the **model name**!
  </Callout>
